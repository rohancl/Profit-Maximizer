# Profit-Maximizer

![Alt Text](/P.png)
<h1>See endpoints in the graph, the greatest value of (x,y)</h1>
 <br>Say your company sells 2 products A and B that make profits M and N respectively.

Profit Maximizer will tell you how much should you sell A and B based on their profits<br>
X = how much should you sell product A<br>
Y = how much should you sell product B

This WebApp would would generate a graph, you'll have to see its intersecting point and add x+y<br>
Say for any point (x,y) = (30,10) means you should sell 30 product A and 10 product B
Voila, that's all.
